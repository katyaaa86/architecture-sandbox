# Architecture sandbox

Welcome to the architecture sandbox. 
It helps you to get acquainted with the basics of building abstractions in practice.

# Tasks

1. Abstraction design

You have some code in `abstraction` module, that calculate distance between two points on the surface of the earth.
This code uses [haversine formula](https://congyuzhou.medium.com/%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D1%83-%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%BC%D1%8F-%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BB%D0%B8-a398352bfbde).

**To do:** Explore the reading list below and rewrite `abstraction` module
with needed interface using theory of abstractions.
